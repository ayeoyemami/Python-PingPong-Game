# Ping Pong Game

This is a simple two-player Ping Pong game implemented in Python using the `turtle` graphics module. The game is designed to be both fun and educational, providing an interactive way to learn Python basics while enjoying a classic arcade-style experience.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay with controls for both paddles.
- Realistic ball physics with wall and paddle collisions.
- Scoring system that tracks and displays player scores.
- Customizable settings for ball speed, paddle size, and screen dimensions.

## Controls
- **Player A:** Use `W` to move the paddle up and `S` to move it down.
- **Player B:** Use the `Up` arrow to move the paddle up and the `Down` arrow to move it down.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayeoyemami/pingpong-game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pingpong-game
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python src/pingpong_game.py
   ```

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This project uses only the standard `turtle` module, so no additional dependencies are required.

## Customization
You can modify the game settings directly in the `pingpong_game.py` script:
- **Ball Speed:** Adjust the `ball.dx` and `ball.dy` variables for faster or slower gameplay.
- **Paddle Size:** Change the `shapesize` parameter for the paddles.
- **Screen Dimensions:** Update the `setup(width, height)` function to alter the game window size.
